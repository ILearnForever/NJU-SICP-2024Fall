# Just for fun Problems

This section is out of scope for our course, so the problems below is optional. That is, the problems in this section **don't** count for your final score and **don't** have any deadline. Do it at any time if you want an extra challenge or some practice with higher order function and abstraction!

To check the correctness of your answer, you can submit your code to Contest 'Just for fun'.
