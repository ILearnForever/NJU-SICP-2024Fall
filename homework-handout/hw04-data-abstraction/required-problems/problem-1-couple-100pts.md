# Problem 1: Couple (100pts)

Implement the function `couple`, which takes in two lists and returns a list that contains lists with i-th elements of two sequences coupled together. You can assume the lengths of two sequences are the same. Try using a list comprehension.

```python
def couple(lst1, lst2):
    """Return a list that contains lists with i-th elements of two sequences
    coupled together.
    >>> lst1 = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> lst2 = [4, 5, 6]
    >>> couple(lst1, lst2)
    [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]
    >>> lst3 = ['c', 6]
    >>> lst4 = ['s', '1']
    >>> couple(lst3, lst4)
    [['c', 's'], [6, '1']]
    """
    assert len(lst1) == len(lst2)
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```
