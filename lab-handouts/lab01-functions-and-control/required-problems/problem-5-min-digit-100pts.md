# Problem 5: Min Digit (100pts)

Write a function that takes in a non-negative integer and return its min digit. (Using floor division and modulo might be helpful here!)

```python
def min_digit(x):
    """Return the min digit of x.

    >>> min_digit(10)
    0
    >>> min_digit(4224)
    2
    >>> min_digit(1234567890)
    0
    >>> # make sure that you are using return rather than print
    >>> a = min_digit(123)
    >>> a
    1
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

> Test your implementation with `python ok -q min_digit`.

> Test your code for lab01 with `python ok`, and submit with `python ok --submit`.
