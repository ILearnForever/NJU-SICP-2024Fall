# Instructions

In this lab, you have three tasks:

* Think about what python would display [section 3](https://sicp.pascal-lab.net/2024/labs/lab01/3.html).
* Draw environment diagrams for the code in [section 4](https://sicp.pascal-lab.net/2024/labs/lab01/4.html).
* Complete the required problems described in [section 5](https://sicp.pascal-lab.net/2024/labs/lab01/5.html) and submit your code with Ok, as instructed in lab00. The starter code for these problems is provided in `lab01.py`, which is distributed as part of the homework materials.

**Submission**: As instructed before, you need to submit your work using either the VSCode plugin or by running Ok with `python ok --submit`. You are allowed to submit multiple times before the deadline, and your score on this assignment will be the highest out of all your submissions.
