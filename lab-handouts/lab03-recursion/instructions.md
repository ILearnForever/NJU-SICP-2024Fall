# Instructions

In this lab, you have three tasks:

* Think about what python would display if the code described in section 3 were input to a python interpreter, better without directly running python.
* Draw environment diagrams for the code in section 4.
* Complete the required problems described in section 5 and submit your code with Ok as instructed in lab00. The starter code for these problems is provided in `lab03.py`, which is distributed as part of the lab materials in the `code` directory.

**Submission**: As instructed before, you need to submit your work with Ok by `python ok --submit`. You may submit more than once before the deadline, and your score of this assignment will be the highest one of all your submissions.

**Readings**: You might find the following reference to the textbook useful:
