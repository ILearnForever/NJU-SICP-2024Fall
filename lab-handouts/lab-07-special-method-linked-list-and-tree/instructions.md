# Instructions

In this lab, you have two tasks:

* Think about what would Python display in section 3 and verify your answer with Ok.
* Complete the required problems described in section 4 and submit your code with Ok as instructed in lab00. The starter code for these problems is provided in `lab07.py`, which is distributed as part of the lab materials in the `code` directory.

**Submission**: As instructed before, you need to submit your work with Ok by `python ok --submit`. You may submit more than once before the deadline, and your score of this assignment will be the highest one of all your submissions.
