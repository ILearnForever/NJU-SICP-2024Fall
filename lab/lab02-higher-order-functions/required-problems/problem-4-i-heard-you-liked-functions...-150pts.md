# Problem 4: I Heard You Liked Functions... (150pts)

Define a function `cycle` that takes in three functions `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, as arguments. `cycle` will return another function that should take in an integer argument `n` and return another function. That final function should take in an argument `x` and cycle through applying `f1`, `f2`, and `f3` to `x`, depending on what `n` was. Here's what the final function should do to `x` for a few values of `n`:

* `n = 0`, return `x`
* `n = 1`, apply `f1` to `x`, or return `f1(x)`
* `n = 2`, apply `f1` to `x`, and then `f2` to the result of that, or return `f2(f1(x))`
* `n = 3`, apply `f1` to `x`, `f2` to the result of applying `f1`, and then `f3` to the result of applying `f2`, or `f3(f2(f1(x)))`
* `n = 4`, start the cycle again applying `f1`, then `f2`, then `f3`, then `f1` again, or `f1(f3(f2(f1(x))))`
* And so forth.

_Hint_: most of the work goes inside the most nested function.
