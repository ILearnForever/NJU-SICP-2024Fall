# Instructions

In this lab assignment, you have four tasks:

* Think about what python would display if the code described in section 3 were input to a python interpreter, better without directly running python.
* Draw environment diagrams for the code in section 4.
* Complete the mock exam problems in section 5.
* Complete the required problems described in section 6 and submit your code as instructed in lab00. The starter code for these problems is provided in `lab02.py`.

**Submission**: As instructed before, you need to submit your work with Ok by `python ok --submit`. You may submit more than once before the deadline, and your score of this assignment will be the highest one of all your submissions.
