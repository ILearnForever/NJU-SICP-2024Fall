# Problem 2: Factorial (100pts)

Write a function that takes a positive integer $$n$$𝑛 and returns its factorial.

Factorial of a positive integer $$n$$𝑛 is defined as

$$
n!=\prod_{i=1}^ni=1\times2\times3\times\dots\times n
$$

```python
def factorial(n):
    """Return the factorial of a positive integer n.

    >>> factorial(3)
    6
    >>> factorial(5)
    120
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

> Test your implementation with `python ok -q factorial`.
