# Problem 3: Is Triangle? (100pts)

Write a function that takes three integers (may be nonpositive) and returns `True` if the three integers can form the three sides of a triangle, otherwise returns `False`.

```python
def is_triangle(a, b, c):
    """Given three integers (may be nonpositive), judge whether the three
    integers can form the three sides of a triangle.

    >>> is_triangle(2, 1, 3)
    False
    >>> is_triangle(5, -3, 4)
    False
    >>> is_triangle(2, 2, 2)
    True
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

> Test your implementation with `python ok -q is_triangle`.
