# Just for fun Problems

This section is out of scope for our course, so the problems below is optional. That is, the problems in this section **don't** count for your final score and **don't** have any deadline. Do it at any time if you want an extra challenge.

At this time, we **don't** provide _Online Judgement_. The local **doctest** is enough for you to check your answer. You can find the starter code in `shakespeare.py`.
