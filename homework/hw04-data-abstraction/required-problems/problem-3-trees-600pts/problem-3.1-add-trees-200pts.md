# Problem 3.1: Add trees (200pts)

Define the function `add_trees`, which takes in two trees and returns a new tree where each corresponding node from the first tree is added with the node from the second tree. If a node at any particular position is present in one tree but not the other, it should be present in the new tree as well.

> _Hint_ï¼š
>
> 1. `label(t)` may not be a number.
> 2. _returns a new tree_ means that you should call the `tree` constructor for every nodes of the returned tree.
> 3. Do not modify the given trees or reuse branches directly from the given trees, call `tree` constructors instead.
> 4. Do not simply call `list(branches(t))` to copy the branches of a tree `t`, as it creates a _shallow-copy_ instead of a _deep-copy_ of the list.
> 5. You may want to use `copy_tree` defined in `ADT.py` to **deep-copy** a tree.
