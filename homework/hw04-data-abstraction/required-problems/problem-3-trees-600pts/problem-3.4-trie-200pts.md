# Problem 3.4: Trie (200pts)

Write a function `has_path` that takes in a tree `t` and a string `word`. It returns `True` if there is a path starting from the root, along which the entries spell out the word. Otherwise, it returns `False`. (This data structure is called a trie, and it has a lot of cool applications!---think autocomplete). You may assume that every node's label is exactly one character.

```python
def has_path(t, word):
    """Return whether there is a path in a tree where the entries along the path
    spell out a particular word.

    >>> greetings = tree('h', [tree('i'),
    ...                        tree('e', [tree('l', [tree('l', [tree('o')])]),
    ...                                   tree('y')])])
    >>> print_tree(greetings)
    h
      i
      e
        l
          l
            o
        y
    >>> has_path(greetings, 'h')
    True
    >>> has_path(greetings, 'i')
    False
    >>> has_path(greetings, 'hi')
    True
    >>> has_path(greetings, 'hello')
    True
    >>> has_path(greetings, 'hey')
    True
    >>> has_path(greetings, 'bye')
    False
    """
    assert len(word) > 0, 'no path for empty word.'
